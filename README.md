# Simple Maven Projects

This repository contains basic Maven projects using **Tomcat**, **JDK 11.0.12**, and developed in **Spring Tool Suite 4 (STS4)**. The projects demonstrate the creation of both **WAR** (Web Application Archive) and **JAR** (Java Archive) files using **Maven**.

- **WAR Project**: A simple web application packaged as a WAR file and deployable on Tomcat.
- **JAR Project**: A standalone Java application packaged as a JAR file.

These projects serve as examples for beginners looking to understand Mavenâ€™s build process for different application types.
